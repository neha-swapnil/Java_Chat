# Java_Chat
A group chat project done using simple socket programming using java MulticastSocket class.

A MulticastSocket is a (UDP) DatagramSocket, with additional capabilities for joining “groups” of other multicast hosts on the internet.

Simply writing the code of server and client we can save them and run simultaneously on different cmds/terminals and see an active communication being established between the users. The connection can be cut by first terminating the client program then the server.
